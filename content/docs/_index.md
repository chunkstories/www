Welcome to the Chunk Stories documentation! This is meant to be the number one place of interest for anyone wishing to use Chunk Stories and get involved in it's development. This documentation will try to complement the admittedly still very incomplete code documentation, not just paraphrase it but actually provide guidance and tips on how to achieve things. There is much to do and much to write about, and as this is a fairly large project sadly not everything is as nicely documented as we'd like. Be assured this is meant to be a work in progress !

> Warning: this documentation is under construction. Most of it is at best incomplete, at worst outdated and wrong.
