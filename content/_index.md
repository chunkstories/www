Chunk Stories is a [free and open source](https://github.com/Hugobros3/chunkstories/blob/master/LICENSE.MD) block game and engine written on the JVM using Kotlin and Java. It features a high amount of attention to the extensibility and moddability of the engine, and an unreasonnable amount of bikeshedding since the start of the project in 2015.
